## Data Sources

### Current Providers

- **[skills.sh](https://skills.sh)** - Community-curated skills leaderboard
  - All Time (`/`) - Total installs ranking
  - Trending (`/trending`) - Recent growth ranking  
  - Hot (`/hot`) - Daily installs ranking

### Planned Providers

- **GitHub Trending** - Popular skill repos on GitHub
- **Awesome Lists** - Curated awesome-* lists for AI agent skills

### Manual Skills

Skills not tracked by any provider can be manually added via `data/manual_skills.json`:

```json
{
  "skills": [
    {
      "source": "owner/repo",
      "skillId": "skill-name",
      "name": "Skill Display Name",
      "installs": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

Manual skills will be:
- Fetched for their `SKILL.md` from GitHub (using standard skill folder detection)
- Included in `skills_index.json` with `providerId: "manual"`
- **Not** overwritten by the crawler (they persist across runs)
- **Deduplicated**: If skills.sh later tracks a manual skill, it will use skills.sh data instead

Note: `installs` should be at least 1 (minimum value).

## Output Files

The crawler generates files in the `data/` directory:

### `data/skills.json`

Complete skill data containing all three leaderboards:

```json
{
  "updatedAt": "2024-01-27T00:00:00.000Z",
  "allTime": [...],
  "trending": [...],
  "hot": [...]
}
```

### `data/skills_index.json`

Website-friendly index for *all* skills (built from `data/skills.json`):

- Includes `description` as a **path** to `description_en.txt` (when a cached `SKILL.md` exists under `data/skills-md/`)
- Includes `skillMdPath` so your website can fetch and render the full markdown
- **Deduplicated** by `id` (`<source>/<skillId>`). If the upstream data contains duplicates, the index keeps the entry with the highest `installsAllTime`.

### `data/feed.json`

Simplified feed format (top 50 from each leaderboard).

It also tries to enrich each item with a `description` by fetching the corresponding GitHub `SKILL.md` (cached under `data/skills-md/`):

```json
{
  "title": "Skills Feed",
  "description": "Aggregated AI agent skills from multiple sources",
  "link": "https://github.com/user/skills_feed",
  "updatedAt": "2024-01-27T00:00:00.000Z",
  "topAllTime": [...],
  "topTrending": [...],
  "topHot": [...]
}
```

### `data/skills-md/`

Cached `SKILL.md` files fetched from GitHub, using common skill folder locations such as:

- `skills/<skillId>/SKILL.md` (most common)
- `.claude/skills/<skillId>/SKILL.md`
- `.cursor/skills/<skillId>/SKILL.md`
- `.codex/skills/<skillId>/SKILL.md`
- `plugins/<plugin-name>/skills/<skillId>/SKILL.md` (common in plugin-based repos, e.g. Expo)

When a `SKILL.md` is present, the crawler also generates:

- `description_en.txt` (extracted from the SKILL.md frontmatter `description` when available)

By default, the crawler only fetches `SKILL.md` for skills included in the top lists (to keep the daily job fast).

If you really want to sync *all* skills from `data/skills.json`, you can run:

```bash
SYNC_ALL_SKILL_MDS=1 bun run crawl
```

### `data/feed.xml`

RSS 2.0 feed (XML). This is meant for RSS readers / subscriptions.

- It is generated from the current crawl + the previous `data/feed.json`
- It only publishes meaningful changes (new entries / rank jumps) to avoid spamming

## Usage

### Local Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Run crawler
bun run crawl
```

Tip: if you want more complete GitHub `SKILL.md` coverage (including plugin-style paths like `plugins/*/skills/...`),
set `GITHUB_TOKEN` to avoid GitHub API rate limits:

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_xxx
bun run crawl
```

### GitHub Actions

After pushing to GitHub, the crawler will:

1. Run automatically daily at UTC 0:00
2. Support manual triggering (click "Run workflow" in Actions tab)
3. Run automatically on push to main branch

## Using in Your Website

You can fetch data directly via GitHub Raw URL:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<username>/<repo>/main/data/skills.json
```

Or use jsDelivr CDN (faster):

```
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/<username>/<repo>@main/data/skills.json
```

### RSS Subscription (Recommended)

Subscribe to the RSS feed:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<username>/<repo>/main/data/feed.xml
```

Or via jsDelivr CDN:

```
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/<username>/<repo>@main/data/feed.xml
```

### Example Code

```typescript
// In Next.js
const SKILLS_DATA_URL = 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/your-username/skills-crawler@main/data/skills.json';

export async function getSkillsData() {
  const res = await fetch(SKILLS_DATA_URL, {
    next: { revalidate: 3600 } // Revalidate every hour
  });
  return res.json();
}
```

## Notes

- Data is updated daily
- Please comply with each provider's terms of service
- For personal learning and research purposes only

## Recommended Tools

Outputs from learn-skills (notes, summaries, data) pair well with AI presentation tools to quickly turn them into shareable slides.
